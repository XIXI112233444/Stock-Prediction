## Project Overview

This project is designed to predict stock market trends by analyzing sentiment in financial news and Reddit posts. It uses FinBERT, a specialized BERT model for financial sentiment analysis, and integrates this sentiment data with various machine learning models to predict stock prices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XIXI112233444/Stock-Prediction
   ```
   After uploading your project, replace the placeholder URL above with your actual GitHub repository URL.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Downloading FinBERT Model

This project relies on the [FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) model for sentiment analysis. You can download the model using the following code snippet:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("ProsusAI/finbert")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("ProsusAI/finbert")
```

Alternatively, if you have downloaded the model manually, place it in the `./finbert_model/` directory.

## Usage

### Running Sentiment Analysis

To analyze sentiment in financial news data, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input path_to_your_input_file.csv
```

This command will process the news data, analyze sentiment using FinBERT, and save the results to a CSV file.

### Training Models

The project includes several models for predicting stock prices based on sentiment data:

- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- 12-layer GRU
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Linear Regression

To train these models, ensure you have the processed sentiment data, then execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will train the models, save their parameters, and evaluate their performance.

### Model Evaluation

Evaluation results, including metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ², MAPE, and direction accuracy, will be logged during training. Additionally, the script generates plots comparing actual versus predicted values and the error distribution across different models.

## Models and Evaluation

The following models are trained and evaluated as part of this project:

- **GRU and LSTM**: Deep learning models suited for sequential data.
- **SVM**: A machine learning model that uses hyperplane separation for regression tasks.
- **Linear Regression**: A simple linear approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Each model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and direction accuracy.
